Guitar Hero/RB Section: 

> [Guitar Hero World Tour Definitive Edition](https://ghwt.de)
*Forget about clone hero and use this instead, you can import songs from clone hero into the game too!*

> [Guitar Hero 2 Deluxe(PS2)](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/Guitar-Hero-II-Deluxe)
> *if you're having troubles with setting this up, alec has a good video on this for pcsx2!. I might make a text tutorial here if i can but for now use [alec's video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ8JIMBVBmE&t=378s)*
> *you're gonna need PCSX2 Nightly - 1.7.3771 if you're gonna play using keyboard (its really old but its the only latest build that has Guitar controller emulation)*

> [Guitar Hero 2 Deluxe (X360)](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/Guitar-Hero-II-Deluxe-360)

Emulators i currently use:

> [PCSX2](https://pcsx2.net)
*Really good emulator, was fun experimenting around the settings to see how far can i make it without bugs on the most underclocked state of the EE and VU*

>[AetherSX2](https://www.aethersx2.com/archive/)
*due to the amount of death threats/anger coming towards stenzek. The emulator has been put on a indefinite development pause. hopefully the blue cube can once again spin #allhailthebluecube*

> [Vita3k](https://vita3k.org/)
*big warning, this emulator is in development and experimental. some games will work and some games will not. The current builds are not representative of its final form.*

> [Dolphin Emulator](https://dolphin-emu.org/)
*Since i mostly use this for emulating guitar hero games, I do not have prior experience emulating other games like Open-World games and such. You may find gameplay videos in youtube. Bear in mind this emulator is very cpu dependant.*

> [RPCS3](https://rpcs3.net/)
*This Emulator is also experimental and in-Development so please bear in mind that although it may have graphical issues/bugs. This is a good emulator. therefore no, this will not run in your toaster.*
